## Design Recommendations

### For Foz da Cova, I recommend implementing all three dashboards because:

3. **Scalability:** System can grow with the community
4. **User Experience:** Each interface is optimized for specific needs
5. **Consistency:** Unified design system across all interfaces

### Key Success Factors:
- **Mobile-First Design:** Works well for field work
