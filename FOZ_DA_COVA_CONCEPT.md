# FOZ DA COVA â€“ Concept, Vibe & Visual Direction

## ðŸŒ± Objective
Foz da Cova is a living land project focused on stewardship, community care, and regenerative living. The goal of the website and system is to:
- Create an **easy-to-use, lightweight platform** for visitors, administrators, stewards, and WWOOFers.
- Encourage **participation and ownership** by allowing stewards to coordinate projects and WWOOFers to contribute meaningfully.
- Provide **accountability, clarity, and beauty** without complexity.
- Support **three distinct user roles** with appropriate permissions and interfaces.

## âœ¨ Vibe & Essence
- **Nature-centered, grounded, regenerative.**
- Feels **inviting, warm, and minimal**â€”no excess, no overwhelm.
- A digital reflection of the **care, simplicity, and respect for land and people** that the project stands for.
- **Community-focused** with clear role definitions and responsibilities.

## ðŸ§­ Design Direction (for Cursor to Follow)

1. **Minimal and fast-loading:** No heavy frameworks. Pure HTML/CSS with optional tiny JavaScript if strictly necessary.
2. **Mobile-first:** Design for phones first, then scale up.
3. **Visual Calm:** Lots of white/neutral space, soft earthy tones, nothing aggressive or over-saturated.
4. **Natural Flow:** Rounded buttons, soft shadows, minimal hard lines.
5. **Readable & Friendly Typography:** Use `Inter` or another clean sans-serif.
6. **Organic Visual Cues:** Circles, soft curves, plant-inspired details.
7. **Role-Based Design:** Each user type gets an interface optimized for their responsibilities.
